# About me

Hello! I'm Alex. A telecom engineer passionate about space technology and navigation systems. 

I was born in La Vall d'Uixó (Castelló) on October 19, 1999. Currently, I live in Valencia, Spain. 

Allow me to provide you with some details that will help you get to know me better:


## Education & Experience

From 2017 to 2021, I studied the Bachelor's Degree in Telecommunication Engineering at Universitat Politècnica de València (UPV). By the third year, I specialised in telecommunication systems where I could learn about radionavigation, spatial communications, antennas, and many more subjects I was really interested in. In February 2021, I joined the Air Navigation Systems (SNA) research group from the UPV to start an intership at the same time I was doing my bachelor's thesis. Under the name "Design and Validation of Reflector Elements to Increase the Radar Cross-Section of Small Drones", the project consisted of designing Luneburg lenses, some kind of passive radar reflectors, with the aim of being inserted in the structures of small drones to enhance their RCSs and thus, providing radars with passive ways of detection, tracking, and identification of drones. 

From 2021 to 2023, I studied the Master's Degree in Telecommunication Engineering also at UPV. During the first year, I continued to accrue valuable work experience at the SNA group by developing multi-radar tracking algorithms for integrating low-cost radars with GNSS-based systems. For the master's thesis, and thus, during my last academic year, I could initiate in the world of ATM with techniques to provide real-time data of the airplanes positions to ATCs through the implementation of hybrid error estimators and inverse location problems using localization/regularization algorithms based on TDOA, AOA, and FDOA for space-based multilateration in ADS-B systems, making use of LEO satellite constellations. 


## Languages

I'm someone who thoroughly enjoys the process of learning languages. The fascination of exploring different linguistic systems and unlocking new avenues of communication has always captivated me. The excitement of immersing myself in diverse cultures and gaining insights into their rich heritage through their languages fuels my passion for language learning. Whether it's mastering the intricacies of grammar rules, expanding my vocabulary, or engaging in conversations with native speakers, I embrace the challenges and rewards that come with this lifelong pursuit. I'm fluent in four languages, and learning a fifth one, which are:

    English: C1/C2 level - Full professional proficiency
    French: B2/C1 level - Professional working proficiency
    Spanish: Native 
    Valencian: Bilingual proficiency
    Russian: Basic knowledge - Elementary proficiency


## Certificates 

I'm an avid learner with a deep passion for all things aviation-related. I find great joy in expanding my knowledge and understanding of this dynamic industry. To quench my thirst for knowledge, I actively seek out courses and educational opportunities that delve into various aspects of aviation. These courses provide me with valuable insights, enabling me to explore topics such as aviation safety, air traffic control, and aviation management. By continuously investing in my education, I strive to enhance my understanding of the aviation sector and stay up-to-date with the latest advancements. The following certificates correspond to courses offered by EUROCONTROL that allowed me to broaden my knowledge in the world of aviation.
